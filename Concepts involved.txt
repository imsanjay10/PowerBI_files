For the past few weeks there has been a lot of buzz in social media about the 2024 electoral bonds. 
With my basic knowledge of creating dashboards and DAX functions in Power BI, I decide to take a crack at it. 
There were some slightly difficult challenges on making dashboard as ‘Indianised’  as possible but eventually I found out some ways by surfing in the internet. 
Here’s the list:
1.	Number system 	:   
	Power BI by default displays the numerical values in the western number system format. 
	This is going to be slightly difficult to comprehend since we are accustomed to the values is ‘crores’ than in ‘billions’ when it comes to Indian currency.
	So, I created a calculated column by dividing the existing numerical value with 1,00,00,000. This will give me the values in crores.
	I then used it to calculate the total amounts.
2.	Date Slicer 	:   
	If a user wants to calculate or analyse the spendings from ‘x’ to ‘y’ time frame, I created a date table ranging from April 2019 to March 2024.
	Then I created a 2 many to one relationship for the encashers and the purchasers table. 
	This will help a user to choose any specific date range.
3.	Cumulative Sum  :
	I wanted to create a time series chart which will visualize the cumulative sum of the political parties during the 5 year tenure. 
	Here, I surfed through the internet and used a DAX query to create 2 cumulative sums, one for bond purchasers and the other for the bond encashers.


These were the challenges which I encountered to overcome my dashboard design. Feel free to ping me on linkedin @akysanjayram for more suggestions.
